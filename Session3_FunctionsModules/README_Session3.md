# **Understanding Functions and Modules in Python**

This notebook is part of the third session on oceanographic data processing. In this session, we will focus on creating and utilizing Python functions and modules. We begin with a simple exercise on functions, demonstrating their key benefits such as modularity, reusability, and readability. Then, we gradually introduce **Ekman dynamics** and explore how to organize related functions into a module for future use in subsequent sessions.

### **Overview**:
---
1. **Introduction to Functions**:
   - We start with the basics of defining and using functions in Python, emphasizing the importance of modularity, error reduction, and parameterization.
   - A hands-on example calculates the area of rectangles and squares using a function. This example will help solidify the understanding of basic function structure.

2. **Exercise: Circle Area Calculation**:
   - You will create a function to calculate the area of a circle. This allows for practice with function definitions and parameterization.

3. **Creating a Python Module**:
   - We organize functions into a Python module. This step involves creating a `.py` script with all necessary functions and importing it into the main notebook.
   - We walk through the process of saving and importing the module for use in later sessions.

4. **Ekman Dynamics**:
   - After reviewing the basics of functions, we transition into **Ekman dynamics**â€”an important concept in physical oceanography.
   - We create custom functions to calculate wind stress and curl, Ekman transport, and Ekman pumping. These functions are then organized into a Python module (`ekman_dynamics.py`) for use in **Session 4**.
