    "Functions are a foundational concept in programming and offer numerous advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modularity:** Functions divide a program into smaller parts, making it clearer and easier to maintain. For Ekman calculations, processes such as wind stress calculation can have their own function.  \n",
    "**Reusability:** A defined function can be used multiple times, eliminating repetitive code. With a function like `calculate_area`, you can calculate the area of a rectangle for various length and width by just calling it.  \n",
    "**Error Reduction:** Testing individual functions can reduce errors when updating code. If one function works, it doesn't need retesting when you adjust other parts of your code.  \n",
    "**Parameterization:** Functions allow parameter adjustments easily.   \n",
    "**Readability:** Descriptive function names make the main code more understandable.    \n",
    "**Scalability:** Functions can be updated or extended easily.\n",
