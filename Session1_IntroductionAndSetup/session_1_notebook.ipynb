    "In Python, especially with libraries like xarray, numpy, or pandas, you can perform various statistical operations by appending methods like .mean(), .std(), or .sum() to your data structures. Downsampling, or reducing data resolution using methods like [`coarsen()`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.coarsen.html), can be useful for several reasons, such as improving performance, aligning data with coarser grids, or reducing noise for analysis. For example, when reducing resolution from 0.25° to 1°, you can use a window size of 4 and apply functions like .mean(). Don’t forget to update metadata, such as units, after downsampling.     \n",

While slicing is a direct approach to selectively display data, making visualizations more intelligible, coarsen provides a more comprehensive representation by spatially averaging the data. This ensures key information is retained, but the spatial variability within the data is smoothed out. This is because it averages over specified spatial windows, and as a result, finer-scale variations that fall below the size of this window are effectively lost or averaged out.  \n",
