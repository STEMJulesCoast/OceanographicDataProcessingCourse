    "# Automating Notebook Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Code and comments often require updates and revisions, and this applies to my notebooks as well. With this script, you can automatically download updated notebooks and replace the existing ones in your local repository. While this can also be done manually, this method is much more efficient.  Additionally, this script allows you to easily download solution scripts automatically. All you need to do is adjust the `github_urls` and `local_paths` to match your (or my ðŸ˜ƒ) needs."
