### Preparation for Ekman Dynamics and Wind Patterns

For Session 3 and 4, please review foundational concepts in Ekman dynamics, wind fields over the ocean, and atmospheric circulation cells. This will provide important context for understanding the Ekman transport and its impact on ocean circulation.

Suggested areas of focus:

- Oceanic Wind Patterns: The influence of steady wind patterns (e.g., trade winds and westerlies) on surface currents.
- Atmospheric Cells: Basics of the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, which shape wind direction over the ocean.
- Ekman Dynamics: How wind and the Coriolis effect interact to create Ekman transport.
