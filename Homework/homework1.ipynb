    "# Homework: Calculate IOD Composites from SST Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will calculate SST composites based on the Dipole Mode Index (DMI). The DMI is used to quantify the strength of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean. The DMI is calculated as the difference in SST anomalies between two specific regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Western Indian Ocean (10S-10N, 50E-70E)\n",
    "- Southeastern Indian Ocean (10S-0, 90E-110E)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the SST in the western region is warmer than in the eastern region, a positive IOD event occurs, while the opposite leads to a negative IOD event. These phases affect climate patterns across surrounding regions, making the DMI a useful tool for understanding regional climate variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is structured to guide you through the key steps we've covered in the previous sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess SST data, choose the same period as in the excercises ([`session_2_notebook.ipynb`](../Session2_DataHandling/session_2_notebook.ipynb)).\n",
    "2. Calculate anomalies and detrend the SST data.\n",
    "3. Calculate the DMI from the monthly detrended SST anomalies.\n",
    "4. Calculate SST composites based on positive and negative IOD events.\n",
    "5. Plot the results over the Indian Ocean, visualizing both positive and negative IOD phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to use the script [`enso_functions.py`](../Session2_DataHandling/enso_functions.py) as a reference. Within this script, you will find functions and calculations similar to what you need for this task. Feel free to copy and adapt the relevant code snippets as needed for your calculations.\n"
